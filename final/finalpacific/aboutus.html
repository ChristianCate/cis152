                <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>   
                <p>
                    Throughout our lives we here at Pacific Trails Resort have all shared a common philosophy - We are more ourselves when we are more in touch with ourselves, as well as the natural world around us. With this mentality, we gathered together to help bring this sense of self awareness to others who hope to achieve the same zen state.

                <h2>Why the California Coast?</h2>
                <p>
                    With its breathtaking landscape and natural beauty, we felt this location to be the perfect representation of our goals and lifestyle. With magnificent weather, gorgeous sandy beaches, and a backdrop of misty mountains, it is much easier to feel at peace with ones self when being surrounded by such tranquil environments.
