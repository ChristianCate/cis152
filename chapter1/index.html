    <p>While I try to avoid sweeter liquids and tend to enjoy my coffee black, the Cinnamon Cream Coldbrew from Better Buzz is quite possibly the tastiest beverage I have ever experienced. The strong caramel flavors with a nice cinnamon touch pairs perfectly with their smooth yet powerful coffee that is almost dangerous in making you forget how much caffine is in the drink. If I could I would replace water with it.</p>
